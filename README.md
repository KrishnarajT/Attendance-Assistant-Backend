# Attendance-Assistant-Backend
Python backend for attendance assistant. 


# Collections in MongoDB

- Every collection must have a unique `_id` field generated by MongoDB.
- Some collections have circular dependencies, so upon adding a document to a collection, the document's ID must be added to the appropriate field in the dependent collection. *This has to be done very carefully.* 

## Specializations
This includes things like `Core`, `Cybersecurity`, `Ai-ML`, etc. Every school will by default have a `Core` specialization. It is specializations that will have panels. not schools.

```json
{
  "_id": "Specialization ID Generated by MongoDB",
  "name": "Specialization Name",
  "panels": ["Panel ID 1", "Panel ID 2"]
}
```

## Subjects
These are subjects that are taught to any panel. They are meant to be atomic. 
```json
{
    "_id": "Subject ID Generated by MongoDB",
    "name": "Subject Name",
    "subject_code": "Subject Code"
}
```

## Schools
These are schools, so they are broad classifications. They will have specializations. `Core` by default. Eg. School of Computer Science, School of Mechanical Engineering, etc. 
```json
{
  "_id": "School ID Generated by MongoDB",
  "name": "School Name",
  "specializations": ["Specialization ID 1", "Specialization ID 2"]
}
```

## Semesters
Every panel will have semesters. This is primarily to keep track of what subjects are taught to a panel in the current semester. And quite important to calculate attendance of a student. 
```json
{
  "_id": "Semester ID Generated by MongoDB",
  "semester_number": 1,
  "panel": "Panel ID",
  "specialization": "Specialization ID",
  "school": "School ID",
  "start_date": "2021-08-01",
  "end_date": "2021-12-31",
  "subjects": [
    "Subject ID 1",
    "Subject ID 2"
  ],
  "teachers": [
    "Teacher ID 1",
    "Teacher ID 2"
  ],
  "teacher_subjects": {
    "subject_id 1": "Teacher ID 1",
    "subject_id 2": "Teacher ID 2"
  }
}
```

## Panels
```json
{
  "_id": "Panel ID Generated by MongoDB",
  "panel_letter": "A",
  "school": "School ID",
  "specialization": "Specialization ID",
  "students": [
    "Student ID 1",
    "Student ID 2"
  ],
  "semesters": [
    "Semester ID 1",
    "Semester ID 2"
  ],
  "current_semester": "Semester ID"
}
```

## Students
```json
{
  "_id": "Student ID Generated by MongoDB",
  "name": "Student Name",
  "prn": "10322108888",
  "panel": "Panel ID",
  "panel_roll_no": 1,
  "face_encoding": "Encoding ID"
}
```

## Encodings
```json
{
    "_id": "Encoding ID Generated by MongoDB",
    "student": "Student ID",
    "encoding": "Encoding link of firebase",
    "number_of_faces": 10
}
```

## Teachers
```json
{
  "_id": "Teacher ID Generated by MongoDB",
  "name": "Teacher Name",
  "email": "teacher.name@mitwpu.edu.in",
  "subjects": [
    "Subject ID 1",
    "Subject ID 2"
  ],
  "panels": [
    "Panel ID 1",
    "Panel ID 2"
  ]
}
```

## Classes
```json
{
  "_id": "Class ID Generated by MongoDB",
  "name": "Class Name",
  "date": "2021-08-01",
  "start_time": "10:00",
  "end_time": "11:00",
  "subject": "Subject ID",
  "teacher": "Teacher ID",
  "panel": "Panel ID",
  "semester": "Semester ID",
  "students_present": [
    "Student ID 1",
    "Student ID 2"
  ],
  "students_absent": [
    "Student ID 3",
    "Student ID 4"
  ]
}
```
